[The GitHub repository](netbox-docker-github) houses the components needed to build NetBox as a container.
Images are built regularly using the code in that repository and are pushed to [Docker Hub][netbox-dockerhub], [Quay.io][netbox-quayio] and [GitHub Container Registry][netbox-ghcr].

Do you have any questions?
Before opening an issue on Github,
please join [our Slack][netbox-docker-slack] and ask for help in the [`#netbox-docker`][netbox-docker-slack-channel] channel.

## Quickstart

To get _NetBox Docker_ up and running run the following commands.
There is a more complete [_Getting Started_ guide on our wiki][wiki-getting-started] which explains every step.

```bash
git clone -b release https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker.git
cd netbox-docker
tee docker-compose.override.yml <<EOF
version: '3.4'
services:
  netbox:
    ports:
      - 8000:8080
EOF
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
```

The whole application will be available after a few minutes.
Open the URL `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` in a web-browser.
You should see the NetBox homepage.
In the top-right corner you can login.
The default credentials are:

* Username: **admin**
* Password: **admin**
* API Token: **0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567**

## Container Image Tags

New container images are built and published automatically every ~24h.

> We recommend to use either the `vX.Y.Z-a.b.c` tags or the `vX.Y-a.b.c` tags in production!

* `vX.Y.Z-a.b.c`, `vX.Y-a.b.c`:
  These are release builds containing _NetBox version_ `vX.Y.Z`.
  They contain the support files of _NetBox Docker version_ `a.b.c`.
  You must use _NetBox Docker version_ `a.b.c` to guarantee the compatibility.
  These images are automatically built from [the corresponding releases of NetBox][netbox-releases].
* `latest-a.b.c`:
  These are release builds, containing the latest stable version of NetBox.
  They contain the support files of _NetBox Docker version_ `a.b.c`.
  You must use _NetBox Docker version_ `a.b.c` to guarantee the compatibility.
  These images are automatically built from [the `master` branch of NetBox][netbox-master].
* `snapshot-a.b.c`:
  These are prerelease builds.
  They contain the support files of _NetBox Docker version_ `a.b.c`.
  You must use _NetBox Docker version_ `a.b.c` to guarantee the compatibility.
  These images are automatically built from the [`develop` branch of NetBox][netbox-develop].

For each of the above tag, there is an extra tag:

* `vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y`:
  This is the same version as `vX.Y.Z-a.b.c` (or `vX.Y-a.b.c`, respectively).
  It always points to the latest version of _NetBox Docker_.
* `latest`
  This is the same version as `latest-a.b.c`.
  It always points to the latest version of _NetBox Docker_.
* `snapshot`
  This is the same version as `snapshot-a.b.c`.
  It always points to the latest version of _NetBox Docker_.

Then there is currently one extra tags for each of the above tags:

* `-ldap`:
  These container images contain additional dependencies and configuration files for connecting NetBox to an LDAP directory.
  [Learn more about that in our wiki][netbox-docker-ldap].

## Documentation

Please refer [to our wiki on GitHub][netbox-docker-wiki] for further information on how to use the NetBox Docker image properly.
The wiki covers advanced topics such as using files for secrets, configuring TLS, deployment to Kubernetes, monitoring and configuring NAPALM and LDAP.

Our wiki is a community effort.
Feel free to correct errors, update outdated information or provide additional guides and insights.

## Getting Help

Feel free to ask questions in our [GitHub Community][netbox-community]
or [join our Slack][netbox-docker-slack] and ask [in our channel `#netbox-docker`][netbox-docker-slack-channel],
which is free to use and where there are almost always people online that can help you in the Slack channel.

If you need help with using NetBox or developing for it or against it's API
you may find [the `#netbox` channel][netbox-slack-channel] on the same Slack instance very helpful.

## Dependencies

This project relies only on *Docker* and *docker-compose* meeting these requirements:

* The *Docker version* must be at least `19.03`.
* The *docker-compose version* must be at least `1.28.0`.

To check the version installed on your system run `docker --version` and `docker-compose --version`.

## Updating

Please read [the release notes][releases] carefully when updating to a new image version.
Note that the version of the NetBox Docker container image must stay in sync with the code.

If you update for the first time, be sure [to follow our _How To Update NetBox Docker_ guide in the wiki][netbox-docker-wiki-updating].

## Rebuilding the Image

`./build.sh` can be used to rebuild the container image. See `./build.sh --help` for more information.

For more details on custom builds [consult our wiki][netbox-docker-wiki-build].

## Tests

We have a test script.
It runs NetBox's own unit tests and ensures that all initializers work:

```bash
IMAGE=netboxcommunity/netbox:latest ./test.sh
```
