# netbox-docker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ninech/netbox-docker.svg?branch=master)][travis]

This repository houses the components needed to build Netbox as a Docker container.
Images built using this code are released to [Docker Hub][netbox-dockerhub] every night.

[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/ninech/netbox-docker
[netbox-dockerhub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/ninech/netbox/tags/

## Quickstart

To get Netbox up and running:

```
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/ninech/netbox-docker.git
$ cd netbox-docker
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The application will be available after a few minutes.
Use `docker-compose port nginx 8080` to find out where to connect to.

```
$ echo "http://$(docker-compose port nginx 8080)/"
http://0.0.0.0:32768/

# Open netbox in your default browser on macOS:
$ open "http://$(docker-compose port nginx 8080)/"

# Open netbox in your default browser on (most) linuxes:
$ xdg-open "http://$(docker-compose port nginx 8080)/" &>/dev/null &
```

Alternatively, use something like [Reception][docker-reception] to
connect to _docker-compose_ projects.

Default credentials:

* Username: **admin**
* Password: **admin**
* API Token: **0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567**

## Dependencies

This project relies only on *Docker* and *docker-compose* meeting this requirements:

* The *Docker version* must be at least `1.13.0`.
* The *docker-compose version* must be at least `1.10.0`.

To ensure this, compare the output of `docker --version` and `docker-compose --version` with the requirements above.

## Configuration

You can configure the app using environment variables. These are defined in `netbox.env`.
Read [Environment Variables in Compose][compose-env] to understand about the various possibilities to overwrite these variables.
(The easiest solution being simply adjusting that file.)

To find all possible variables, have a look at the [configuration.docker.py][docker-config] and [docker-entrypoint.sh][entrypoint] files.
Generally, the environment variables are called the same as their respective Netbox configuration variables.
Variables which are arrays are usually composed by putting all the values into the same environment variables with the values separated by a whitespace ("` `").
For example defining `ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost ::1 127.0.0.1` would allows access to Netbox through `http://localhost:8080`, `http://[::1]:8080` and `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Production

The default settings are optimized for (local) development environments.
You should therefore adjust the configuration for production setups, at least the following variables:

* `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Add all URLs that lead to your netbox instance.
* `DB_*`: Use a persistent database.
* `EMAIL_*`: Use your own mailserver.
* `MAX_PAGE_SIZE`: Use the recommended default of 1000.
* `SUPERUSER_*`: Only define those variables during the initial setup, and drop them once the DB is set up.

### Running on Docker Swarm / Kubernetes / OpenShift

You may run this image in a cluster such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes or OpenShift, but this is advanced level.

In this case, we encourage you to statically configure Netbox by starting from [Netbox's example config file][default-config], and mounting it into your container using the mechanism provided by your container platform (i.e. [Docker Swarm configs][swarm-config], [Kubernetes ConfigMap][k8s-config], [OpenShift ConfigMaps][openshift-config]).

But if you rather continue to configure your application through environment variables, you may continue to use [the built-in configuration file][docker-config].
We discourage storing secrets in environment variables, as environment variable are passed on to all sub-processes and may leak easily into other systems, e.g. error collecting tools that often collect all environment variables whenever an error occurs.

Therefore we *strongly advise* to make use of the secrets mechanism provided by your container platform (i.e. [Docker Swarm secrets][swarm-secrets], [Kubernetes secrets][k8s-secrets], [OpenShift secrets][openshift-secrets]).
[The configuration file][docker-config] and [the entrypoint script][entrypoint] try to load the following secrets from the respective files.
If a secret is defined by an environment variable and in the respective file at the same time, then the value from the environment variable is used.

* `SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`: `/run/secrets/superuser_password`
* `SUPERUSER_API_TOKEN`: `/run/secrets/superuser_api_token`
* `DB_PASSWORD`: `/run/secrets/db_password`
* `SECRET_KEY`: `/run/secrets/secret_key`
* `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: `/run/secrets/email_password`
* `NAPALM_PASSWORD`: `/run/secrets/napalm_password`

Please also consider [the advice about running Netbox in production](#production) above!

#### A Note On OpenShift

OpenShift usually is configured with specific restrictions regarding root users.
[Special care][openshift-root] has to be taken when building images for OpenShift.
The Docker Image that may be built using this project (and which is available on Docker Hub) might not yet run without further customization on OpenShift.
If you have this running on OpenShift, it would be nice if you could open a PR with the changes you needed to make.
Or if you didn't do any changes and it just worked, that you could confirm this so that we can remove this notice.

[openshift-root]: https://docs.openshift.org/latest/creating_images/guidelines.html#openshift-specific-guidelines

## Version

The `docker-compose.yml` file is prepared to run a specific version of Netbox.
To use this feature, set the environment-variable `VERSION` before launching `docker-compose`, as shown below.
`VERSION` may be set to the name of
[any tag of the `ninech/netbox` Docker image on Docker Hub][netbox-dockerhub].

```
$ export VERSION=v2.2.6
$ docker-compose pull netbox
$ docker-compose up -d
```

You can also build a specific version of the Netbox image. This time, `VERSION` indicates any valid
[Git Reference][git-ref] declared on [the 'digitalocean/netbox' Github repository][netbox-github].
Most commonly you will specify a tag or branch name.

```
$ export VERSION=develop
$ docker-compose build --no-cache netbox
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Hint: If you're building a specific version by tag name, the `--no-cache` argument is not strictly necessary.
This can increase the build speed if you're just adjusting the config, for example.

## Troubleshooting

This section is a collection of some common issues and how to resolve them.
If your issue is not here, look through [the existing issues][issues] and eventually create a new issue.

[issues]: (https://github.com/ninech/netbox-docker/issues)

### Docker Compose basics

* You can see all running containers belonging to this project using `docker-compose ps`.
* You can see the logs by running `docker-compose logs -f`.
  Running `docker-compose logs -f netbox` will just show the logs for netbox.
* You can stop everything using `docker-compose stop`.
* You can clean up everything using `docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans`. **This will also remove any related data.**
* You can enter the shell of the running Netbox container using `docker-compose exec netbox /bin/bash`. Now you have access to `./manage.py`, e.g. to reset a password.
* To access the database run `docker-compose exec postgres sh -c 'psql -U $POSTGRES_USER $POSTGRES_DB'`
* To create a database backup run `docker-compose exec postgres sh -c 'pg_dump -U $POSTGRES_USER $POSTGRES_DB' | gzip > db_dump.sql.gz`
* To restore that database backup run `docker-compose exec postgres sh -c "su postgres -c 'dropdb $POSTGRES_DB --if-exists; createdb $POSTGRES_DB'"; gunzip -c db_dump.sql.gz | docker exec -i $(docker-compose ps -q postgres) sh -c 'psql -U $POSTGRES_USER $POSTGRES_DB'`.

### Getting a "Bad Request (400)"

> When connecting to the Netbox instance, I get a "Bad Request (400)" error.

This usually happens when the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable is not set correctly.

### How to upgrade

> How do I update to a newer version?

It should be sufficient to pull the latest image from Docker Hub, stopping the container and starting it up again:

```bash
docker-compose pull netbox
docker-compose stop netbox
docker-compose rm -f netbox
docker-compose up -d netbox
```

## Rebuilding & Publishing images

`./build.sh` is used to rebuild the Docker image:

```
$ ./build.sh --help
Usage: ./build.sh <branch> [--push]
  branch  The branch or tag to build. Required.
  --push  Pushes built Docker image to docker hub.

You can use the following ENV variables to customize the build:
  BRANCH   The branch to build.
           Also used for tagging the image.
  DOCKER_REPO The Docker registry (i.e. hub.docker.com/r/DOCKER_REPO/netbox)
           Also used for tagging the image.
           Default: ninech
  SRC_REPO Which fork of netbox to use (i.e. github.com/<SRC_REPO>/netbox).
           Default: digitalocean
  URL      Where to fetch the package from.
           Must be a tar.gz file of the source code.
           Default: https://github.com/${SRC_REPO}/netbox/archive/$BRANCH.tar.gz
```

## Tests

To run the test coming with Netbox, use the `docker-compose.test.yml` file as such:

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm app
```
